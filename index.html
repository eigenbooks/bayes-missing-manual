           A decade ago, I thought Bayes theorem would revolutionize the way I solved problems. My personal Bayesian revolution never occurred, so I started trying to understand why. This is the missing manual I wish I had all those years ago. It is an attempt to use a small but relevant subset of Bayesian statistics with simple and consistent language to solve a large subset of practical problems in your everyday life.
          </p>
          <p>
           Why was figuring out how to use Bayes theorem on day-to-day problems so important? I believe that there are three key mathematical skills everyone needs. In my opinion, these skills far surpass anything you might learn in algebra, geometry, or calculus class. They are mathematical skills that you need to simply navigate through life without making serious blunders:
          </p>
          <ol class="simple">
           <li>
            <p>
             Make rough order of magnitude estimates
            </p>
           </li>
           <li>

             Understand how compound interest works

           <li>
            <p>
             Think with probabilities
            </p>
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           First on the list is making
           <a class="reference internal" href="math-prereq.html#rom">
            <span class="std std-ref">
             rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimates
            </span>
           </a>
           . An order of magnitude is a multiple of 10. So an order of magnitude error is when you are wrong by a factor of 10. For example if you think you will earn $1000 per month, and it turns out you only make $100 per month. Order of magnitude errors can ruin your life and, yet, are surprisingly easy to identify.
          </p>
          <!-- Imagine that your very best friend in the world wants you to invest your life savings into their *duck company*. Your friend needs to sell 7 pounds of meat from each duck to break even. So this begs the question: How much does a duck weigh? Duck hunters and chefs please bear with me, this is the most ludicrous example I could come up with.

A duck certainly weighs more than 0.1 lb and less than 10 lb. A duck probably weighs on the order of 1 lb...According to Google, a Mallard duck weighs 1.6 – 3.5 lbs, close enough for a rough estimate! Clearly the answer is not the required 7 lbs. 

You may not care about the weight of a duck, but there are other even more bizarre quantities that you don't know, and neither does Google (really!), but you need to solve your own problems. The important thing to note from this example, is that you can come up with a ROM estimate for *nearly anything* if you try.  -->
          <p>
           Second on the list is compound interest. It is great when you earn interest, but horrible when you have to pay interest. Failing to understand compound interest can again ruin your life - think crushing student loan debt and not being able to retire when you body starts to give out on you.
          </p>
          <p>
           Lastly, is

           </a>
           . Life is uncertain. Sometimes things work out in your favor, sometimes they don’t. If you are ignorant of probabilities you might unwittingly make a big bet on a single event that has a low probability of occurring without realizing your risk - again possibly ruining your life. If instead you can embrace probabilities you can make more frequent but smaller bets without bankrupting yourself until you find a winning strategy. This manual attempts to make thinking with probabilities easy.

           In general, Bayes theorem is a mathematical formula that allows you to incrementally update your existing beliefs as new evidence or information is observed. While very rigorous, the usual presentation of Bayes theorem is very theoretical and complex. It is left to the reader to tailor Bayes theorem to their specific use, which can be very challenging.
          </p>
          <p>
           This manual covers only one potential application of Bayes theorem. So within this manual Bayes theorem is a mathematical formula that allows you to incrementally calculate the relative odds that a hypothesis explains the evidence that you are observing. Luckily, this easy to use version covers a wide range of practical problems you might encounter while walking around on the street on a day-to-day basis.

           Bayes theorem is a result of probability theory and statistics. Probability and statistics are two closely related mathematical fields. Probability is a quantitative description of how likely an event is to occur. Statistics can be split into two branches.
          </p>
          <p>
           The first is descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics summarize data and aim to present them in a manner that is useful for interpretation. The second branch is inferential statistics. Inferential statistics  allows you to make predictions (inferences) based on data.
          </p>
          <p>
           Bayes theorem is a type of statistical inference. I like

            the goal of statistical inference is to help you decide what to believe in
           </em>
           . All three domains - probability, descriptive statistics, and statistical inference - are useful when applying Bayes theorem so it is good not to casually refer to them as the same thing.
          </p>
          <p>
           In common language usage, probability and statistics are used interchangeably. Furthermore, there are multiple interpretations of probability and the version being used is often assumed to be implicitly understood. The same notation is used across different fields and interpreted to mean different things, so concise communication can be difficult to achieve. Therefore, it is good not to casually refer to them as the same thing.
          </p>
          <p>
           Bayesian probability - the sole focus of this manual - is simply a belief. Contrast this to the more popular definition of probability as a frequency of occurrence. The
           <em>
            frequentist
           </em>
           definition is more popular and represents a more concrete situation where it is possible to count all the possible outcomes. Typically frequentist probability examples include dice, coins, and cards. The Bayesian definition is more abstract, but potentially very useful.
          </p>
          <p>
           Bayesian inference uses Bayes theorem to revise your beliefs based on observed data. Bayes theorem may also be known as Bayes Rule and Bayes Law. Technically, Bayes theorem should be written as Bayes’ theorem. It is common practice to omit the apostrophe for the sake a brevity

           The use of Bayes theorem can be applied to multiple situations, in various forms, using a variety of analytical and numerical techniques. In short, there are a lot of ways to use Bayes theorem. As a rough guideline, I divide the possible methods into model comparison and parameter estimation. This manual covers a simple method for model comparison that only requires simple mental math. Each formulation is briefly described below so you can identify if your use case fits with what is described in this manual.

           <p>
            A model is a simplified representation of reality. Bayes theorem can be used to compare the relative likelihood of two or more models and identify the model that is
            <em>
             best
            </em>
            . In this manual, we cast model comparison in this way: Which hypothesis (aka: model of the world) best describes the evidence (data) that we are observing? There are multiple ways to develop a model, the evidence/hypothesis method shown here is simplistic and applicable to on your feet reasoning.
           </p>
           <p>
            Typically, a hypothesis will be binary in nature, for example true/false, fake/real, success/failure, win/lose, honest/corrupt, etc. It will also be shown how to compare a finite number of hypotheses greater than two, such as who is the most likely murder suspect among a group of three people, by repeatedly applying the
            <a class="reference internal" href="solution-process.html#process">
             <span class="std std-ref">
              standard solution process
             </span>
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            A very real limitation is that each hypothesis must be explicitly defined. In practice it can be hard to generate hypotheses because you may be at one of the extremes - either it seems obvious what happened or there is very little information to build a hypothesis from. Human biases can dominate the hypothesis generation step as well, for example, stereotypes, preconceived notions, racism, and bigotry will all color how hypotheses are generated by an individual. Bayes theorem can help overcome some, but not all, human biases.
           </p>
           <p>
            Using the methods in this manual you can evaluate which hypothesis best explains the evidence you are observing.
            <em>
             Best
            </em>
            is a relative term in this context. If you generate two rather bad hypotheses one will always be identified as the best at explaining the evidence. In absolute terms both hypotheses might be bad and the real reason you are observing the evidence will be a hypothesis you have not considered. For example, say your friend claims to be able to identify if a coin will land heads or tails using psychic powers, which you don’t believe in. After calling 14 coin tosses in a row correctly, there would seem to be substantial evidence that your friend is a coin toss psychic. The odds of randomly guessing the outcome of 14 coin tosses in a row is very low - approximately odds of 1 to 100,000. You can either admit you have been wrong your whole life about psychic powers in the presence of this evidence, or you can consider an alternate hypothesis that better describes the situation you are seeing - that your friend is cheating somehow.
           </p>
           <p>
            Despite its limitations, this manual will demonstrate how to apply the model comparison formulation of Bayes theorem to a wide array of problems.

            that crash into the ocean. A classic example of parameter estimation (and other complex calculations) is intercepting a ballistic missile. Imagine that a rogue state fires a ballistic nuclear missile in your general direction. The weapon is of unknown manufacturer and is going Mach 3 in the upper atmosphere. Radar measurements for objects at high altitudes and fast speeds are far from perfect. Use Bayes theorem(!) to identify the most likely position of the weapon based on the noisy radar measurements and shoot an interceptor missile to down the rogue states weapon.

            Another less dramatic example is estimating the probability of a probability. Say you are playing a game of chance with your friend. You each put a dollar down every time you flip a coin. If the coin comes up heads, he wins the money. If the coin comes up tails, you win the money. You flip ten times and observe 8 heads and 2 tails. So far you have lost $6. You begin to wonder if you are flipping a fair coin. Bayes theorem and parameter estimation would help you reason about the fairness of your coin. The data you have collected so far showed heads occurring in 80% of the tosses. You want to know the
            <em>
             probability that the probability
            </em>
            of the coin landing heads is 0.5 (i.e. a fair coin). With parameter estimation you could develop a probability distribution describing your belief about the fairness of the coin and make statements about confidence intervals - all very useful, but relatively

            The objective of this manual is to help you solve real world problems using Bayes theorem. In this manual, a real world problem will have some of the following characteristics.
           </p>
           <ul class="simple">
            <li>
             <p>
              Internal probabilities - Real world problems are usually unlike card games, dice, and coins. These problems are best solved with internal probabilities. Who will win a future election, will your actions hurt your spouses feelings, will customers like the fresh mint scent, are all examples of problems where your internal probabilities (aka your subjective opinion) is the best - or only - way to quantify your beliefs.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Not well studied - Most real world problems are your personal problems and not great mysteries of mankind. As such there is likely nobody tracking historical data about your problem. There are certainly ways to apply Bayes theorem to deep scientific mysteries, but they are not directly discussed in this manual.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Hard problems - From your perspective your problems are hard. Otherwise you would have solved the problem already. If you can figure out even a rough hacky solution to your problem in a few seconds of thought, then you will have made good progress. You can always pile on time and resources later if your initial assessment shows that there will possibly be a good return on investment.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            In summary this manual aims to help you solve hard problems that we know little about initially and even a rough solution will be of benefit.

           If you have a use case that this book does not cover there are some very good books on Bayesian statistics and Bayes theorem that are available. My only warning is to make sure you understand what you hope to achieve from your analysis before you use an advanced technique. These resources will be less opinionated than this manual about which particular Bayesian method will solve your needs - which may or may not be a good thing.
