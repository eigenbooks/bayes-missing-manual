          The quintessential example for introducing Bayes theorem is a medical diagnostics test. This example from Eliezer Yudkowsky is a classic and explains why the example is attention grabbing:
         </p>
         <blockquote>
          <div>
           <p>
            1% of women at age forty who participate in routine screening have breast cancer. 80% of women with breast cancer will get positive mammographies.  9.6% of women without breast cancer will also get positive mammographies. A woman in this age group had a positive mammography in a routine screening.  What is the probability that she actually has breast cancer?
           </p>
           <p>
            Next, suppose I told you that most doctors get the same wrong answer on this problem - usually, only around 15% of doctors get it right. See Casscells, Schoenberger, and Grayboys 1978; Eddy 1982; Gigerenzer and Hoffrage 1995; and many other studies.  It’s a surprising result which is easy to replicate, so it’s been extensively replicated.

          We will return to the quintessential example described above later in this chapter. To illustrate the process for solving problems with Bayes theorem we will pick a problem that has convenient round looking numbers to make things easy. There are many ways to solve problems, but for the sake of consistency we will use this standard approach over and over in this manual.

          Multiple studies show that thinking about concrete numbers such as “20 out of 100 students” is more likely to produce correct spontaneous reasoning on these problems than thinking about percentages like “20% of students”

          Of the 20 students with diseasitis, the tongue depressor would turn black for 90% of them. In our example 18 out of the 20 sick students would be identified as sick with a black tongue depressor. Of the healthy students, 30% of them would turn the tongue depressor black despite being healthy. In our example 24 of the 80 healthy students would test positive for diseasitis even though they were sick.

          for a visual representation of the results. This result can be a bit counter intuitive because the test is correct 90% of the time. There were relatively few cases of diseasitis to begin with, which makes the odds of actually having the disease much lower than the 90% true positive rate reported for the test.

           Out of a representative group of 100 students, 20 of them would have diseasitis and the other 80 would be healthy. Set the prior odds to 20:80 which simplifies to 1:4.

           What is the likelihood that if you make the tongue depressor black you will be sick? It depends if you are in the sick or healthy box…

          <p>
           The relative likelihood in our example is 0.9:0.3, or 90:30, or 3:1 when simplified (see
           <a class="reference internal" href="#to-1-likelihood-box">
            <span class="std std-numref">

           </a>
           ). Note that a relative likelihood is not a probability. This example intentionally shows that the likelihood does not have to sum to 1. Much like relative odds, the relative likelihood is a ratio. If your data supports both hypotheses equally well then the relative likelihood is close to one. The relative likelihood helps you quantify the strength of your evidence. Only when the evidence strongly supports one hypothesis over another does the relative likelihood revise your prior beliefs. The best data points to collect differentiates your competing hypothesis by having a relative likelihood that is far from one.

          <p>
           At this point you can visually inspect your diagram and get a sense for what the posterior odds are. The odds that you are sick, given that you turned a tongue depressor black, is the ratio of the two shaded areas. In our example the shaded ‘sick’ rectangle is a little bit smaller than the shaded ‘healthy’ rectangle, so the odds of being sick a a bit under 1:1, or a bit less than 0.5 probability.

           In the Yudkowsky example the odds of being sick given a positive test are 800:9504, roughly equivalent to 8:95, or approximately a 0.08 probability of being sick. This is shocking because medical professionals reportedly struggle to correctly calculate the probability of sickness. I will however contend that their inability to properly calculate the correct answer does not imply that they lack the proper medical intuition to provide good care. As the name implies, a screening test is the first of potentially many tests that would be administered if a diagnosis of cancer is suspected. To my knowledge there is no crisis in the medical communities treatment of cancer. Mainly this example is useful for teaching Bayes theorem, not influencing the training of doctors. In my opinion thinking with Bayes theorem is much more important than calculating a precise answer. Interestingly the accuracy of reading mammographies has increased due to algorithms based in part on Bayes theorem
           <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ai-screening" id="id3">
            3
           </a>
           since the studies citing that medical professionals can’t calculate the correct answer were published.
          </p>
          <p>
           Another interesting intersection of Bayes theorem and breast cancer screening involved a controversy in 2009 when a U.S. Government task force suggested that women should start getting mammograms to screen for breast cancer at age 50, instead of at the customary age of 40
           <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#task-force" id="id4">
            4
           </a>
           . It also suggested changing the rate of screenings from every two years to every three years. The argument is that the base rate of cancer in 40 year old women is so low that the cost of false positives (healthy women with a test that seemed to indicate cancer) outweighed the benefits of the testing for the population as a whole. The downsides include radiation exposure and unnecessary treatment. As the son of a breast cancer survivor and the father of daughters this recommendation certainly evokes an emotional response that highlights the difference between

          <p>
           The standard process for using Bayes theorem throughout this article will be:
          </p>
          <ol class="simple">
           <li>
            <p>
             Identify the problem as a candidate for Bayes theorem. Usually the data arrives prior to generating a hypothesis, and you are uncertain about the underlying mechanisms generating the data.
            </p>
           </li>
           <li>
            <p>
             Clearly state the question you are trying to answer in terms of a belief.
            </p>
           </li>
           <li>
            <p>
             Establish two or more competing hypothesis that might explain the data you are observing.
            </p>
           </li>
           <li>
            <p>
             For accounting purposes, decide how you will be writing the odds. For example - sick:healthy or maybe healthy:sick
            </p>
           </li>
           <li>
            <p>
             Identify the prior odds.
            </p>
           </li>
           <li>
            <p>
             Establish the relative likelihood of the data occurring
             <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#likelihood" id="id6">
              5
             </a>
             . It may help to follow this internal prompt to establish the relative likelihoods:
            </p>
            <ul class="simple">
             <li>
              <p>
               If your first hypothesis is true, what would be the probability of observing this data
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               If your second hypothesis is true, what would be the probability of observing this data
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Continue this questioning for each hypothesis
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Then, take the ratio of the probabilities as your relative likelihood. Don’t worry if they don’t sum to 1.
              </p>
             </li>
            </ul>
           </li>
           <li>
            <p>
             Calculate the posterior odds using term-by-term multiplication
            </p>
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           If you only have two hypothesis, you can visualize the results by drawing a diagram:
          </p>
          <ol class="simple">
           <li>
            <p>
             Start by drawing a square to represent the entirety of the probability space
            </p>
           </li>
           <li>
            <p>
             Set your priors, then draw a vertical line to divide the square into two areas proportional to your prior odds. If the prior odds of
             <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">
              \(H_1:H_2\)
             </span>
             are 1:4 then imagine dividing the square into 5 equal vertical parts, then draw a line that divides the space into a segment of one and a segment of four.
            </p>
           </li>
           <li>
            <p>
             Set your relative likelihoods. Shade each respective part to show the likelihood of the data given the hypothesis. If your relative likelihood is 0.9:0.3 = 9:3 = 3:1 then shade 90% of the area that represents
             <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">
              \(H_1\)
             </span>
             and 30% of the area that represents
             <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">
              \(H_2\)
             </span>
            </p>
           </li>
           <li>
            <p>
             The posterior odds are represented by the ratio of the shaded areas.
            </p>
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           With a mathematical form of
           <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">
            \(a \times b = c\)
           </span>
           there are only a couple different ways you can get Bayes theorem wrong. The most likely routes to failure are:
          </p>
          <ol class="simple">
           <li>
            <p>
             Math error - simply failing to define the odds properly or making an arithmetic error
            </p>
           </li>
           <li>
            <p>
             Choosing inaccurate prior odds
            </p>
           </li>
           <li>
            <p>
             Choosing inaccurate likelihood odds
            </p>
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           Luckily Bayes theorem inherently handles uncertainty well. As long as your estimates of the prior odds and relative likelihood are accurate to an

This includes easy word problems to give you practice with the mechanics of using the formula and then progresses in difficulty up to seemingly intractable problems. At first everything you need to work the problem will be contained in the example. After that the problems will delve into real life scenarios. Everything hinges on your ability to pick somewhat reasonable prior odds and likelihood ratios. There is often no “right” answer to these types of problems, but probably a wrong answer. Getting a
